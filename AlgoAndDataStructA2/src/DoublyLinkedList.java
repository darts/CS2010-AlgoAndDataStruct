/**
 * Class DoublyLinkedList: implements a *generic* Doubly Linked List.
 * 
 * @param <T> This is a type parameter. T is used as a class name in the
 *        definition of this class.
 *
 *        When creating a new DoublyLinkedList, T should be instantiated with an
 *        actual class name that extends the class Comparable. Such classes
 *        include String and Integer.
 *
 *        For example to create a new DoublyLinkedList class containing String
 *        data: DoublyLinkedList<String> myStringList = new
 *        DoublyLinkedList<String>();
 *
 *        The class offers a toString() method which returns a comma-separated
 *        sting of all elements in the data structure.
 * 
 *        This is a bare minimum class you would need to completely implement.
 *        You can add additional methods to support your code. Each method will
 *        need to be tested by your jUnit tests -- for simplicity in jUnit
 *        testing introduce only public methods.
